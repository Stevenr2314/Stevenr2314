### Hello, I'm Steven👋🏽

  I am a student at Bloomtech Institute, making my way towards a fully fledged Full Stack Developer. I hope to get my foot into the professional world of programming, helping to create apps and other such programs. 
  
  Currently working on my Hunter's Manual app, a React based encyclopedia for Monster Hunter World.
  
  Learning Python on the side to expand my knowledge.
